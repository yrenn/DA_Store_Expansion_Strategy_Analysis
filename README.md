# DA_Store_Expansion_Strategy_Analysis


## Project Background

The telecommunications company is currently facing a critical decision regarding strategies to accelerate prepaid gross subscriber additions. The President of Mobility has mandated an evaluation of two pivotal options:

#### Option 1: Partnering with a Leading Retail Chain

This option involves collaborating with a prominent retail chain to enhance subscriber additions.

#### Option 2: Building Direct Stores

This option focuses on establishing direct stores to increase subscriber numbers.

## Evaluation Criteria

The assessment will be based on the following key factors:

- **Revenue:** Estimating potential earnings from both options, factoring in subscriber growth projections and average revenue per user (ARPU).

- **Costs:** Including initial setup costs, operational expenses, marketing investments, and any other pertinent financial outlays for each option.

- **Margins:** Calculating both gross and net margins to understand the profitability of each strategy.

- **Net Present Value (NVP):** Utilizing NVP calculations to gauge the financial viability of each option, considering the time value of money.

Utilizing Microsoft Excel to generate comprehensive reports and charts for conducting comparisons.

## KPIs and formulas
 - Gross income/profit = revenue â€“ cost
 - Monthly Revenue  = (#store*(#unit + #adjust))  *  $ prepaid
 - Total Revenue = SUM(monthly revenue)
 - Cost = churn (rate * revenue) + commission(#unit * $commission) + Share_Split(revenue* split_rate) +  rent_fixture(#location* fee)

## Potential Impact and Further Improvements

#### Adjustment Parameters

To refine the evaluation and make a well-informed decision, consider adjusting the following parameters:

- **Prepaid Price (KPI):** Modifying the prepaid_price can impact overall revenue. Test different price points to assess their effect on the financial model.

- **Share Split (KPI):** Adjusting the share_split parameter can alter profit distribution. Test various share split ratios to find the most favorable balance.

## Best Portfolio: Retail Chain Store and Direct Stores

#### Optimal Combination

Based on the adjusted parameters and thorough analysis, the best portfolio could involve a hybrid approach, combining both strategies for maximum impact:

- **Leading Retail Chain Stores:** Leverage the retail chain's customer base for immediate market penetration and brand recognition.
- **Direct Stores:** Establish direct stores in strategic locations to ensure complete control over branding and customer experience.

#### Further Adjustments

Continuously monitor the market and adjust the KPIs (e.g., prepaid_price, share_split) as needed. Regularly revisit the strategy based on changing market dynamics and consumer behavior to maintain a competitive edge and maximize profitability.
